# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is an experiment: every line of code, docs, and metadata was generated by an AI coding agent, guided by human product decisions and UX testing. To honor that constraint, contributions should follow an ‚ÄúAI-first‚Äù workflow.

## Guiding Principle: AI‚ÄëGenerated Changes (with reasonable exceptions)

- Prefer AI‚Äëgenerated diffs for substantive changes (code, behavior, significant docs or refactors).
- Reasonable exception: tiny human edits are welcome for one‚Äëliner clarifications, typo fixes, link updates, and similar non‚Äëbehavioral doc tweaks.
- For hand‚Äëwritten code or broader doc rewrites, please open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- For substantive changes, include a brief ‚Äúprovenance‚Äù note in your PR description (which agent/tool you used and the prompt/intent). For trivial doc fixes, this is optional.

## How to Contribute

1) Open an Issue
- Propose a feature, bug fix, or doc change with a minimal reproduction or example.
- If proposing dependencies or CLI UX changes, outline the rationale, scope, and alternatives.

2) Prepare a PR (AI‚Äëfirst)
- Generate the change with your preferred AI coding agent.
- Keep diffs focused and small; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Update relevant docs when applicable:
  - `README.md` (usage, key bindings, troubleshooting)
  - `CODE_MAP.md` (new files, flows, or architectural notes)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (add an entry under Unreleased)

3) Local Dev
- Requirements: Node.js 18+
- Install: `npm install`
- Lint/format:
  - `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`
  - `npm run format` (JS/MD only)
- Manual checks (no formal tests yet):
  - `npm run gptbrowser -- zips/export.zip`
  - `npm run browsezip -- zips/export.zip`
  - Or use `npx chatgpt-export-viewer <zip>` once published.

4) PR Checklist
- [ ] Substantive changes are AI‚Äëgenerated (note provenance in the PR description). Trivial doc fixes are exempt.
- [ ] `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run format` pass locally
- [ ] README/CODE_MAP/CHANGELOG updated as needed
- [ ] No unrelated changes; no large assets or data added

## Scope & Style

- Scope small, composable changes; avoid broad rewrites.
- Stay consistent with existing patterns:
  - TUI: use `lib/terminal.js` helpers (`listMenu`, `makeListSearch`, `wrapLines`)
  - ZIP/GPT: use `lib/zip.js` and `lib/gpt.js` helpers
  - Viewers/openers: use `lib/viewers.js` and `lib/open_external.js`
- Defaults: Node ESM, ESLint v9 flat config, Prettier.
- Avoid adding new runtime deps without discussion.

## Security & Privacy

- Don‚Äôt include sensitive data or real exports in the repo.
- Keep CLIs deterministic and robust: structured errors, safe file handling, temp cleanup.

## License

- By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License of this repository.

Thanks for helping keep the experiment consistent and the tool useful! üôè
